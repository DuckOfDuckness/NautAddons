# Addon: Custom Subreddit Text Name
Similar to the [Subreddit Name to Image](https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/wiki/subtitle) addon, but instead of changing the name to an image, it changes it to your custom text.

The addon replaces both the header and sidebar title. You can also just replace either by removing one of the two blocks in the addon.

## Installation

1. Copy the CSS from CustomSubredditNameText.css into the *bottom* of your stylesheet.
2. Change all instances of `NAME` to your custom text.
